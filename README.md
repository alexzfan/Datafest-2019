# Datafest-2019
This project was a data competition held at Emory SP19. We were given data on the Canadian women's rugby team and asked to provide insight into their training regimen to improve game-day performance. We decided to take a backwards analytical approach by first asking what vital/stress factor most predicts game-day performance, grouped by the skill level the opponent. From there, we found the training regimen that would alleviate the stress factor that most negatively impacted the game-day performance. 

We placed as a first-round honorable mention, finishing top-ten.
